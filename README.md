This repository demonstrates a common COBOL programming error involving data type mismatches. The 'bug.cob' file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to move a string value ('Hello') into a numeric field and vice versa.  This can lead to unpredictable results or program termination. The 'bugSolution.cob' file provides a corrected version with proper data type handling and error prevention.
